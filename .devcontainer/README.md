# Codespaces for WordPress VIP

The provided `devcontainer.json` file is configured to create a Codespaces development environment that is as identical as possible to a VIP Platform environment.

Read our documentation to learn how to get started and [work with Codespaces for WordPress VIP applications](https://docs.wpvip.com/local-development/developing-with-github-codespaces/).

Refer to [GitHub's documentation for Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces) to learn more about Codespaces in general.

## Usage Notice

Only customers with [Enhanced or Premier support packages](https://wpvip.com/pricing/) can use Codespaces within the `wpcomvip` GitHub organization.

To work with Codespaces outside of the `wpcomvip` organization, customers can copy the `devcontainer.json` file into their own GitHub repository.

With proper permissions set up, starting a codespace in Browser is straightforward:

1. click Code <> -> Codespaces -> Create codespace
2. Wait for the codespace to be initialized and built. Initial set up might take a few minutes, but this time may be significantly reduced by using prebuilt codespaces (configured on repository level)
